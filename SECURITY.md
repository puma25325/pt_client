# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the PointID client application seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible.

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report it by sending an email to [security@pointid.com](mailto:security@pointid.com) (replace with actual security contact email if available, otherwise use a placeholder).

In your report, please include as much detail as possible:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots that can help us understand the issue.
*   Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up).

We will acknowledge your email within 24-48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to:

*   Promptly addressing reported vulnerabilities.
*   Keeping you informed about the progress of your report.
*   Crediting researchers for their responsible disclosure (if they wish to be credited).

Thank you for helping to keep PointID secure.
