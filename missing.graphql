# Missing GraphQL Operations for Server Implementation
# This file documents GraphQL operations that the frontend expects but are not present in the main schema

# Query: Get user notifications with filtering
# Used by: Assureur dashboard, notification system
# Current implementation: Uses getUserNotifications from main schema
query GetUserNotifications($unreadOnly: Boolean, $notificationType: String, $limit: Int, $offset: Int) {
  getUserNotifications(unreadOnly: $unreadOnly, notificationType: $notificationType, limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
    id
    userId
    notificationType
    title
    message
    relatedEntityId
    relatedEntityType
    priority
    isRead
    createdAt
    expiresAt
    actionUrl
    metadata {
      key
      value
    }
  }
}

# Note: The getUserNotifications query is already defined in the main schema (line 1003)
# This file is kept for reference but no additional operations are needed.
# All GraphQL operations used by the frontend are covered by the main schema.
